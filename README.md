# Food_Deliver_Time_Prediction
This project predicts food delivery times using a machine learning model. It involves preprocessing a dataset of past deliveries, training a regression model (e.g., Random Forest), and evaluating it with metrics like Mean Absolute Error. Users can input order details to get real-time delivery time predictions. This improves efficiency for food delivery services.
